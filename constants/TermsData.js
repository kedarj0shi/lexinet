        'Extract from AP2509 (June 02), Airbus Accident Investigation Policy and Procedure Guide.    ICAO Annex 13 (Amendment 9) Definition:  "An occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft, which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight, until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which:  a) A person is fatally or seriously injured as a result of      a. Being in the aircraft      b. Direct contact with any part of the aircraft, including parts which have become detached from the aircraft      c. Direct exposure to jet blast  Except when the injuries are from natural causes, self-inflicted or inflicted by other persons, or when the injuries are to stowaways hiding outside the areas normally available to the passengers and crew,   or:  b) The aircraft receives substantial damage or structural failure, which adversely affects the structural strength, performance or flight characteristics of the aircraft, and would normally require major repair or replacement of the affected component (before next flight).  Except for engine failure or damage when the damage is limited to the engine, its cowling or accessories; or for damage limited to propellers, wing tips, antenna, tires, brakes, fairing, small dents or puncture holes in the aircraft skin.  or:  c) The aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.  Note: The above definition of an accident does not cover all possible events.    Airbus Expanded Accident Definition:  Airbus has adopted the ICAO definition, but has expanded it beyond aircraft boarding and disembarkation to encompass ground accidents resulting in death or serious injury from aircraft-related causes. In other words, the Airbus definition covers aircraft-related injury or death of passengers, flight and cabin crews, and ground, dispatch, airport, maintenance and cleaning personnel that occur outside of "block times", as well as during any phase of flight operations."',

Margins can also be a means to realise a specific configuration or growth potential (e.g. energy management, IT data capacity, forging sizing etc.).  A margin is decided from experience, and considered necessary to ensure sufficient robustness of the design. Each margin is a judgement based on cost of the margin (in terms of weight, manufacturability, etc.) balanced against the magnitude of the risk reduction that it would provide (in terms of cost/time/probability, etc., to introduce a modification).  Margins are used in the design process to cover uncertainties in requirements definition or in design data. Margins should never replace requirements. Later in the design process, as requirements and design data become more firm, the margins can often be reduced or eliminated",

        "Space allocation models are 3D models, not wire-frame, but solid representation of  parts. SAM models exist through the lifecycle of the project and are associated with  design principles. Structural SAM models can be produced when there is sufficient  maturity of design principle/scheme/layout to warrant the generation in 3D. This may be  driven by complexity around moving surfaces, landing gear systems long-lead time  components or interfaces. SAM models lack definition in the early feasibility and concept  phases and it is only during the end of concept phase and early definition phase (M4-  M5) that the models will have approximate sizing and begin to provide some validation of  weight targets. This means a good approximation for the main features and size of the  component. The benefits of 3D definition for fixed structure facilitates systems routing  that are themselves created using SAM models. However this should only amount to  about 20- 40% of the structure models. 3D definition helps understand and validate  industrialisation (manufacture) and maintenance concepts.  SAM models will mature through the program phases until they reach a definition  standard for production. This means that the revision of the model will be updated whilst  it matures. If these parts are approved and have decomposed to a level suitable for  production use, then the part may be copied to a definition part number. This number  may be the same as the SAM number with the exception of replacing the S with the  relevant ATA section number i.e. L57S0000000000 may become L5730000000000.",
