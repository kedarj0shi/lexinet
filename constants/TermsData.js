Use Team Approach = Use a group with leader with competence authority to solve the problem and corrective actions. 2. Describe the Problem = Describe the problem in measurable terms. Specify the internal or external customer problem by describing it in specific terms. 3. Implement and Verify Short-Term Corrective Actions = Define and implement those intermediate actions that will protect the customer from the problem until permanent corrective action is implemented. Verify with data the effectiveness of these actions. 4. Define and Verify Root Causes = Intermediate actions that will protect the customer until final corrective action is implemented. Verify with data the effectiveness of these actions. 5. Verify Corrective Actions = The selected corrective actions should resolve the problem for the customer and will not cause undesirable side effects and other actions, if necessary, based on potential severity of problem. 6. Implement Permanent Corrective Actions = Define the permanent corrective actions needed. Choose on-going controls to insure the root cause is eliminated. Once in production, monitor the long-term effects and implement additional controls as necessary. 7. Prevent Recurrence = Modify specifications, update training, review work flow, improve practices and procedures to prevent recurrence of this and all similar problems. 8. Congratulate Your Team = Recognize and publicize the collective achievements of your team. Share your knowledge and learning.",

This together with practical considerations related to the frequency of updates does impact configuration management. This section describes non-LSAP databases. NOTE: Databases may be configuration managed independent of LSAPs. This is viewed to have economic advantages to some operators. However, it is recognized that some operators may choose to manage ADBs as LSAP. RTCA DO-200A / EUROCAE ED-76 defines aeronautical data used for applications such as navigation, flight planning, flight simulators, terrain awareness, and other purposes. Navigation, terrain, and obstacle data are examples. Aeronautical data is used by such systems as Flight Management Systems (FMS) and Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) that depend on data describing external factors such as airspace designations, runway locations, and lengths. This data is subject to change and may be updated on a frequent basis. Some ADBs might not be part of the certified aircraft configuration and therefore might not be defined as an aircraft part. While control of such databases is essential, the unique aspects of managing them may be considered by the airline to necessitate a system separate from the configuration management system adopted for LSAPs.",

In particular, this process aims at: - proactively identifying and managing the follow-up actions to mitigate capacity constraints e.g. bottlenecks, through the simulation of the Supply Chain's capacity to meet an Airbus Program rate evolution scenario, - assessing suppliers' production load and capacity over a 3-year period taking into account current and future Airbus confirmed Program rates, - Consequently identify capacity constraints and proactively identify and monitor the actions to mitigate those potential capacity constraints. The CCP may also be used to support the following processes: supplier selection, supplier control and CAPEX Process. CCP is a harmonized capacity assessment approach to be used in the Airbus Supply Chain. It is a tool to assess the capability of the Suppliers to increase their production capacity in order to cope with Airbus confirmed rate increase.",

The advantages to cycle are: - Timely detection and correction of problems. The purpose of the count is first to find the cause of error and then to correct the cause so the error is less likely to happen again. - Complete or partial reduction of lost production - Use of personnel trained and dedicated to cycle counting. This provides experienced inventory takers who will not make the errors &quot;once-a-year&quot; personnel do. Cycle counters are also trained to identify problems and to correct them.",

A DFMEA documents the key functions of a design, the primary potential failure modes relative to each function and the potential causes of each failure mode. The DFMEA method allows the design team to document what they know and suspect about a product's failure modes prior to completing the design, and then use this information to design out or mitigate the causes of failure. Ideally, the DFMEA is begun at the earliest stages of concept development, and can then be used to help winnow down competing designs and to help generate new, more robust concepts.",

Court-ordered or government sanctioned hacking for the purpose of obtaining critical evidence is also a type of e-discovery.The nature of digital data makes it extremely well-suited to investigation. For one thing, digital data can be electronically searched with ease, whereas paper documents must be scrutinized manually. Furthermore, digital data is difficult or impossible to completely destroy, particularly if it gets into a network. This is because the data appears on multiple hard drives, and because digital files, even if deleted, can be undeleted. In fact, the only reliable means of destroying data is to physically destroy any hard drive where it is found.",

Another interest is to ¿slice up¿ debt in various risk slices associated with different repayment priorities and, logically, remuneration. The more risk a lender takes, the higher the remuneration and the lower the lender's repayment priority rank vis-à-vis other lenders. The airline may retain the 20 per cent equity portion of the aircraft through its own funds, as in a secured financing or capital lease or, more commonly, may lease the aircraft from a third party owner participant via a leveraged lease. This basic ETC can be enhanced to an EETC (enhanced equipment trust certificate) by adding further collateral, liquidity facility and risk tranching in order to enhance the quality of the transaction and reduce risk for the senior lenders.

Some experts consider free cash flow to be a better indicator of a company's financial health than earnings, since it effectively replaces depreciation cost of fixed assets (based on historical investment) with the actual replacement cost of fixed assets. Weaknesses of using free cash flow as a substitute for earnings is the inclusion of working capital changes (e.g. a non-payment to suppliers would understate the expense charged against the period's revenues).

The primary elements of Just-In-Time are to have only the required inventory by reducing setup times, queue lengths and lot sizes: to incrementally revise the operations themselves; and to accomplish these activities at minimum cost. In the broad sense, it applies to all forms of manufacturing - job shop, process, and repetitive - and to many service industries as well.",

        "A fitting or other element whose primary function is to resist or react lateral or side loads. For example, an aircraft employing pylons to attach its jet engines to the wings will have a primarily longitudinal load path that is produced through reacting the thrust of the engine, thus establishing forward motion. Additional lateral loads, resulting from; gyroscopic effects, etc., may be reacted through a spigot into a load-bearing fitting that could be attached to primary structure. This fitting is described as the Lateral Load Fitting.",

There is strong evidence that many manufacturers, eager to take advantage of the documented advantages, attempted to implement JIT without first understanding of the fully integrated approach and impacts of such a highly integrated system. This condition led to many disappointing implementations or outright failures of JIT during that period. The fundamental concepts of JIT evolved to an enterprise-wide perspective called lean production. What we originally called JIT is still called JIT in the lean production approach, for it implies the pull system used to deliver just what is needed just in time for the need. Lean production on the other hand implies understanding and correctly implementing the major enterprise-wide changes required to truly eliminate or significantly reduce waste in the system. It is the system-wide philosophical approach used to integrate the system toward an ultimate goal of maximized customer service with minimal system waste.",

        "Long Lead Items (LLI) are components or assemblies that need a longer time to be produced/manufactured. They need an earlier release due to the fact, that either: - they require material, with long lead time and difficult purchasing conditions or/and - they are produced with a complex (new) technology or/and - their manufacture requires complex jigs and tools, which, in turn, need the component shapes and sizes in order to be developed.  Controlled release of Long Lead Item at an earlier stage of definition allows advanced planning/ordering. Design data is to be frozen and released, even in data stages, with full commitment and known risk in the order dictated by specific manufacturing sequences.",

Model Quality is achieved, when a model it is sufficiently correct (fidelity + representativity), complete (granularity) and consistent (robustness) - for a given purpose and context (usage conditions + business processes + development phases). Factors that have an impact on Model Quality are: - The quality of modeling language(s) used, such as their appropriateness for the domain and complexity; - The quality of tools used for modeling and transformations, such as compliance with the modeling languages and capability of combining information; - The knowledge of developers of the problem in hand and their experience of modeling languages and tools in use; - The quality of the modeling processes used; - The quality assurance techniques applied to discover faults or weaknesses. Model quality cannot be sufficiently assessed by only looking at the model itself; other artifacts in the development process must also be considered. Even when all modeling guidelines are fulfilled, complexity per subsystem is low, and the model fulfills all other statically verifiable quality criteria, there is still no guarantee that the model possesses the desired functionality. The functionality can only be verified through a manual model review or functional test. This is why other artifacts must also be considered in model quality assessment.",

Operating leases thus are not included in the lessee's balance sheet, they will be reported in the notes ¿ off balance sheet.

        "Space allocation models are 3D models, not wire-frame, but solid representation of parts. SAM models exist through the lifecycle of the project and are associated with design principles. Structural SAM models can be produced when there is sufficient maturity of design principle/scheme/layout to warrant the generation in 3D. This may be driven by complexity around moving surfaces, landing gear systems long-lead time components or interfaces. SAM models lack definition in the early feasibility and concept phases and it is only during the end of concept phase and early definition phase (M4- M5) that the models will have approximate sizing and begin to provide some validation of weight targets. This means a good approximation for the main features and size of the component. The benefits of 3D definition for fixed structure facilitates systems routing that are themselves created using SAM models. However this should only amount to about 20- 40% of the structure models. 3D definition helps understand and validate industrialisation (manufacture) and maintenance concepts. SAM models will mature through the program phases until they reach a definition standard for production. This means that the revision of the model will be updated whilst it matures. If these parts are approved and have decomposed to a level suitable for production use, then the part may be copied to a definition part number. This number may be the same as the SAM number with the exception of replacing the S with the relevant ATA section number i.e. L57S0000000000 may become L5730000000000.",
